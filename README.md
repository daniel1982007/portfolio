# About me
My name is Daniel. I am a software engineer and I have been
in this industry for almost 4 years. Why I chose this career?
Because we are living in a digital world, almost everything 
around us is connected with these simple 0 and 1. I found it
very interesting, if we use our imagination we can definitely 
build our life in a better way and let the digital work good for 
very everyone.

# My Experience
I worked a long time in a telecom company, so I have technical
background as an engineer. After I switched my career from 
telecom to IT web development, firstly I learned everything
by myself from many resource like youtube, udemy, coursera
and some online courses. Except that I also joined some training
courses offline, in order to meet up with other programmers 
and communicate with them, exchange experience and so on. After
about 1 year of learning, I started to search a job. It was not
easy, but I believe if working hard, the goal can be reached.
