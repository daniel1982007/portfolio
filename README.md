## About me
My name is Daniel. I am a self-learnt software developer from 2018. Before I entered to software world, I was a telecom project manager and mainly worked in Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia and Albania. As long as I worked in my previous job, I was always interested in programming and always thought about to become a software engineer, at last I decided to switch my career. I started from Java, it was the first language that I put all my effort to lean and master. It is the entrance for me to enter into the software world. Learning is a very important attitude as to be a programmer, because technologies in these days are developing so fast. In this career constantly learning new things is a must.
